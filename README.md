# KerasNet-Neural-Network-Modeling-with-Keras-TensorFlow
KerasNet is a Python-based deep learning project that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network using the Keras API in TensorFlow. This project is intended for learning and experimentation with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) on structured datasets such as classification or regression tasks.
